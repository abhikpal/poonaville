## Setting up the development environment

*Poonaville* is a Flask based Python app that uses web sockets for real time
game updates. To set up a development environment, make sure that `pip`
and `virtualenv` are installed on the target system.

The use the following commands to setup a development environment

```
# clone the repo
git clone 'https://github.com/abhikpal/poonaville/'

# create a new virtualenv for poonaville
virtualenv -p python3 venv

# activate the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate

# change to the source code directory and install all required libraires
cd poonaville
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the application.py file to strat the server
python application.py
```

## Usage

The main game projection can be viewed by going to
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/projection/` and the controller can be accessed by
visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. If the game is setup on a local network,
change `127.0.0.1` to the ip address of the machine running the
application (on *nix based machines, use the command `ip addr show` to view
the IP address of the machine).
